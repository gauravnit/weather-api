Features of the project:

This project has been created by the use of Github Co-piolot only. The bare starting 
instruction was following:

#Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current 
#weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it 
#using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you 
#with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

After this just tab and press Enter.Supply the "API_KEY" only manually.
All the other files including README.md are also generated using Co-piolot only 
and are rearranged in the folder structure.
